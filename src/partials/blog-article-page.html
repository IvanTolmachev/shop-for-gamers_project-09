    The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of
    gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.

  <p>
    So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?
  </p>
  <p>
    Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming headphones are
    regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment. However,
    they possess qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too. Audiophilic
    characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval, accurate sound stage
    and immersive sound experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of
    gaming headphones.

  <p>
    However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they have
    any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic like the Blue
    Yeti X for communication support.

    A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous for
    streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio
    Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his games.

    There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones setup
    for gaming.

  <p>
    Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for audio and mic quality As
    you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and mic itself,
    you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic and
    headphones. There is potential for better overall audio and microphone
    quality.
